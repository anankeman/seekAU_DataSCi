Each year we manage over four million aircraft movements carrying more than 156 million passengers,
          and provide air navigation services across 11 per cent of the world’s airspace.
Airservices has two major operating centres in Melbourne and Brisbane and a corporate office in Canberra. We operate 29 air traffic towers at international and
          regional airports, and provide aviation rescue firefighting services at 26 Australian airports.
        The Role
        Network Performance and Analysis (NP&A) are responsible for delivering actionable intelligence to the business around complex Air Traffic Management (ATM) system performance and optimisation. A typical application is the development of high-fidelity
          aircraft trajectory modelling and fast time simulations to assess flight and airspace efficiency, evaluate proposed airspace changes, and provide intelligence on ATM performance that delivers tangible outcomes for our airline customers.
        You will be a part of a multidiscipline team of data scientists, mathematicians, scientists, engineers and subject matter experts to provide services across Airservices groups, with a leading role in the development and innovation of new methodologies
          for evaluating Air Traffic Management performance, and identifying areas for improvement. Our team is dynamic and flexible, and we are all interested in thinking laterally to solve new problems in airspace analysis.
        The Person
        As Modelling and Simulation Lead you will be responsible for the provision of complex fast-time air traffic simulation and other modelling work, as well as the provision of specialist aeronautical and operational support and advice to different
          groups within Airservices.
        You will also be responsible for supervising staff members, managing the team’s workload and priorities, the development of the team’s capabilities and the performance of the team. The role provides support to the Network Performance and Analysis
          Manager, and requires advanced understanding of air traffic operations, systems and functions.The role requires a person with a high level of interpersonal and communications skills, able to establish, develop and maintain effective working
          relationships, and who enjoys innovating, researching, learning new skills and adapting to a variety of challenges.
        You will be expected to apply your expertise to complex data, and draw from relevant experience to support and improve outcomes for Airservices and its airline customers. A key component of the work will be to consider options for proposed airspace
          designs using available data and tools: assessing designs for aircraft efficiency (reduced delay and fuel-burn), and overall airspace efficiency (reduced risk, conflicts, delay and ATC workload).
        Skills and Experience
        The successful applicant will have:
        
          Tertiary qualifications in aviation, science, engineering, computer science, mathematics or a related discipline.
          A minimum of two years professional experience in a similar role, with expertise in a range of technical areas such as modelling, simulation, data analysis, operations research, applied mathematics, scripting and programming languages (experience
            in one or more of the following languages: Python, Java, Matlab, C, or R is required).
          Understanding of the aviation industry, and knowledge / experience in technical aspects of aviation (e.g. aeronautics, air transport operations, air traffic management).

          and AWS certification with big data software exposure.
        Help develop the future of banking
        Our data engineering teams are at the center of fighting financial crime, helping the business with data analytics, data warehousing, and software engineering. We understand the shifting trends towards cloud computing and are excited about the
          possibilities it brings. Our platforms provide a critical foundation to our commitment to protect nabs’ community from Fraud and Financial crime.
        Why the callout?
        We’re going through a bit of a transformation here at NAB – looking for bigger and better ways to make banking a more enjoyable experience for people. That’s where you come in.
        What you’ll be doing
        To thrive in this role, you are excited about data and motivated to learn new technologies. You are comfortable collaborating with engineers from other teams, product owners, business teams, and data analysts and data scientists.
        You are eager to resolve upstream data issues at the source instead of applying workarounds. You analyse and test changes to our data architecture and processes, and determine the possible downstream effects and potential impacts to data consumers.
        In addition to your strong technical capability you will be a proven team player, independent thinker and have a collaborative attitude towards your work and colleagues.
        We are part of NABs Melbourne based technology team with an inclusive and friendly workplace that includes engineers from diverse backgrounds. We value a culture of learning, agility, openness, honesty and continuous improvement.
        What we need from you
        We’re looking for someone with:
        
          Exposure to distributed big data stacks e.g. Spark, PySpark, Kafka, Hive, Flume, Hue & Sqoop.
          Ability to write any app language (C#, Java, etc..) and/or any scripting language (Python, groovy).
          An understanding and/or experience developing data analytics platforms like SAS, SPSS, Tableau, etc.
          Able to work with different data types e.g. streaming, real-time, file based, RDMS, unstructured data, etc.
          Experience working in cloud deployment and management (especially AWS).
          A strong understanding of CI/CD practices.
          An open mindset and proven ability to innovate and influence.
          A passion for learning (tell us about the self-learning courses and certifications you have done - Coursera, Udacity, AWS, etc.)
          Must have an AWS Certification!
        
        While knowing the ins and outs of the latest technology is key for this role, we’re also looking for someone with the potential to grow into a leader. That means great communication and organizational skills are a must – as well as the ability
          to work well with and motivate the people around you.
        We offer:
        
          Fast paced environment, with leading edge technology and innovation

         They are now seeking a data engineer – to assist them on a new programme of work that is completely new in this sector, involving very large amounts of data catered for by their big data platform. The key expertise they are looking for are: MapR,
          Hive, Oozie, Spark, Java and Linux. You will work in a DevOps environment where collaboration is key. The community shares knowledge and uses show cases to demonstrate the key steps.

Alternatively,

          & Machine Learning Modelling, BigData etc. Working as part of a high performing team you will work as part of a broader cross-functional group of Data Scientists and Engineers, Back-End Engineers, UX experts so the ability to communicate
          effectively, enjoy the process of having your ideas positively challenged and also looking to improve your peers output is a key component of my clients culture and expectations for you in this role.
 This role requires a strong coding focus
          so it is important that you have fluent programming skills and a strong grasp of computer science/software engineering fundamentals. Working in an Agile environment with a CI philosophy employed you will need to enjoy keeping current with new
          technologies, tools and methodologies and how they can be practically employed. Alternatively, first class Insights Analyst's will be considered regardless of level of coding although the more the merrier is my clients thoughts on this. 
          The ability to thrive is an environment where your core focus is complex problem solving on a daily basis is key. Candidates can come from a diverse set of disciplines so what is important is that you can combine Advanced Analytics qualities
          with software development qualities and have a decent level of commercial and organisational awareness as you apply your Data Science expertise to solve business problems. 
 This is an exciting time to be joining my client as they continue
          their growth internationally and continue to innovate in a vast variety of ways  (e.g. Self Service Analytics/AI arena.  Whilst these roles require first class technical capabilities equally important is the ability to understand business
          problems, business context, have a grasp of organisational and commercial realities and incorporate effectively all these diverse factors into the analytical features/services and algorithms that you build.  
Any candidates with
          experience in Conversational AI and/or ""Text Analytics and / or Speech Analytics would be at a serious advantage.
 My client offers a first class working environment –  professional, collegiate and creative all in one. Working alongside

          your own self-development is key.
 Ideally I am looking for applications from more Senior candidates (e.g. 5+yrs exp) who can assist with the bigger picture challenges associated with running a high performing product/feature development
          team although candidates with less experience but who can demonstrate they have the technical and business smarts to succeed in this environment should not hesitate to apply.

        The Organisation
        Airservices is a government owned organisation providing safe, secure, efficient and environmentally responsible services to the aviation industry. 
Each year we manage over four million aircraft movements carrying more than 156 million passengers,
          and provide air navigation services across 11 per cent of the world’s airspace.
Airservices has two major operating centres in Melbourne and Brisbane and a corporate office in Canberra. We operate 29 air traffic towers at international and
          regional airports, and provide aviation rescue firefighting services at 26 Australian airports.
        The Role
        Network Performance and Analysis (NP&A) are responsible for delivering actionable intelligence to the business around complex Air Traffic Management (ATM) system performance and optimisation. A typical application is the development of high-fidelity
          aircraft trajectory modelling and fast time simulations to assess flight and airspace efficiency, evaluate proposed airspace changes, and provide intelligence on ATM performance that delivers tangible outcomes for our airline customers.
        You will be a part of a multidiscipline team of data scientists, mathematicians, scientists, engineers and subject matter experts to provide services across Airservices groups, with a leading role in the development and innovation of new methodologies
          for evaluating Air Traffic Management performance, and identifying areas for improvement. Our team is dynamic and flexible, and we are all interested in thinking laterally to solve new problems in airspace analysis.
        The Person
        As Modelling and Simulation Lead you will be responsible for the provision of complex fast-time air traffic simulation and other modelling work, as well as the provision of specialist aeronautical and operational support and advice to different
          groups within Airservices.
        You will also be responsible for supervising staff members, managing the team’s workload and priorities, the development of the team’s capabilities and the performance of the team. The role provides support to the Network Performance and Analysis
          Manager, and requires advanced understanding of air traffic operations, systems and functions.The role requires a person with a high level of interpersonal and communications skills, able to establish, develop and maintain effective working
          relationships, and who enjoys innovating, researching, learning new skills and adapting to a variety of challenges.
        You will be expected to apply your expertise to complex data, and draw from relevant experience to support and improve outcomes for Airservices and its airline customers. A key component of the work will be to consider options for proposed airspace
          designs using available data and tools: assessing designs for aircraft efficiency (reduced delay and fuel-burn), and overall airspace efficiency (reduced risk, conflicts, delay and ATC workload).
        Skills and Experience
        The successful applicant will have:
        
          Tertiary qualifications in aviation, science, engineering, computer science, mathematics or a related discipline.
          A minimum of two years professional experience in a similar role, with expertise in a range of technical areas such as modelling, simulation, data analysis, operations research, applied mathematics, scripting and programming languages (experience
            in one or more of the following languages: Python, Java, Matlab, C, or R is required).
          Understanding of the aviation industry, and knowledge / experience in technical aspects of aviation (e.g. aeronautics, air transport operations, air traffic management).
          Experience in the analysis of complex data using modern data science methods (e.g. machine learning, optimisation, numerical analysis)
          Demonstrated ability to lead and work collaboratively as part of a small multi-disciplinary technical team.
          Demonstrated ability to deliver and present analysis outcomes to different audiences ranging from technical experts to senior management, both orally and in writing.

          The company is the market leader in AI technology and it helps defends businesses from cyber security hacks. It was founded by data scientists and mathematicians from some of the world's leading universities. They have majority market share
            across North America, Europe and are now looking to repeat their success here in the APAC region. Arguably one of the most exciting companies around with a value of more than $1 Billion. 

          The Account Executive needs the following things:
          - a Uni degree (must have)
          - experience doing B2B sales, ideally for a technology business
          - track record of hitting sales targets
          - competitive nature, high energy and desire to want to be successful 

          If you are smart and hungry and can provide the above, then the company will provide you with some of the best training and development (the first of which is done in London and San Francisco) there is to offer and the ability to genuinely earn
            $180K in your first year. The Melbourne office has had all of their reps hit their first 2 quarter targets! 

          So if you've got a degree, a background in B2B Sales and have a desire to sell some of the most innovative technology on the market in an industry that is always in demand then get in touch.

        My client is an innovative Financial Services giant who are committed to the application of Advanced Analytics and Data Science in order to maintain competitive advantage. As their Data Science function (which is building a reputation for delivering
          real advantages within the business) continues to grow and I am looking for experienced Data Science & Data Insights hires to join their team.

I am looking for candidates from either a Software Engineering/Machine Learning background
          or those from either a Data Science or more traditional Statistical/ Predictive Modelling background who have fluent programming skills (Python and R are essential) and typically have strong academics in a relevant discipline (BSc, MSc, PhD
          Data Science, Statistics, Actuarial, Computer Science et al) and who wish to join a high performing team involved in practically every aspect/business function possible and are regarded as increasingly essential to business improvement.
Alternatively,
          If you have solid SQL experience and have real expertise on finding, delivering Insights and turning data into meaningful information that can drive real business (strategic or tactical) decisions and genuinely add value then this could be the
          role for you. 
If you are a Data Scientist who could also walk into a high performing Senior Insights role with a Consulting firm (eg, presentation skills, customer engagement, strategy and planning, insights to find opportunities, 
          drive sales etc.) then stop what you are doing and send me your CV !- I need to speak with you immediately :-)
 Working with other Data Scientists, specialist 3rd party teams & key stakeholders, your core role will involve the design,
          development, testing and deployment of analytically focused algorithms designed to solve business problems. Your tool-kit to deliver on this will include methods and techniques such as Data Visualisation, Natural Language Processing, Statistical
          & Machine Learning Modelling, BigData etc. Working as part of a high performing team you will work as part of a broader cross-functional group of Data Scientists and Engineers, Back-End Engineers, UX experts so the ability to communicate
          effectively, enjoy the process of having your ideas positively challenged and also looking to improve your peers output is a key component of my clients culture and expectations for you in this role.
 This role requires a strong coding focus
          so it is important that you have fluent programming skills and a strong grasp of computer science/software engineering fundamentals. Working in an Agile environment with a CI philosophy employed you will need to enjoy keeping current with new
          technologies, tools and methodologies and how they can be practically employed. Alternatively, first class Insights Analyst's will be considered regardless of level of coding although the more the merrier is my clients thoughts on this. 
          The ability to thrive is an environment where your core focus is complex problem solving on a daily basis is key. Candidates can come from a diverse set of disciplines so what is important is that you can combine Advanced Analytics qualities
          with software development qualities and have a decent level of commercial and organisational awareness as you apply your Data Science expertise to solve business problems. 
 This is an exciting time to be joining my client as they continue
          their growth internationally and continue to innovate in a vast variety of ways  (e.g. Self Service Analytics/AI arena.  Whilst these roles require first class technical capabilities equally important is the ability to understand business
          problems, business context, have a grasp of organisational and commercial realities and incorporate effectively all these diverse factors into the analytical features/services and algorithms that you build. 
 My client offers a first
          class working environment –  professional, collegiate and creative all in one. Working alongside some of the finest Data Scientists and Software Engineers anywhere in Australia you can be sure that this role will offer fantastic challenges
          and opportunities with a real focus on your professional growth. Having a positive attitude towards your own self-development is key.
 Ideally I am looking for applications from more Senior candidates (e.g. 5+yrs exp) who can assist with
          the bigger picture challenges associated with running a high performing product/feature development team although candidates with less experience but who can demonstrate they have the technical and business smarts to succeed in this environment
          should not hesitate to apply.
 In short, this is one of the finest Data Science related opportunities you will see in Sydney in 2018. Strong & innovative leadership, a superb work culture and environment, fabulous opportunities for progression
          given the company trajectory/ pace of growth & the ability to make a meaningful contribution/have a tangible impact on a day to day basis makes this role seriously not to be missed. Please apply online with an up to date CV/Resume or call
          Declan on 0452411968 for a confidential discussion.

Airservices has two major operating centres in Melbourne and Brisbane and a corporate office in Canberra. We operate 29 air traffic towers at international and
          regional airports, and provide aviation rescue firefighting services at 26 Australian airports.
        The Role
        Network Performance and Analysis (NP&A) are responsible for delivering actionable intelligence to the business around complex Air Traffic Management (ATM) system performance and optimisation. A typical application is the development of high-fidelity
          aircraft trajectory modelling and fast time simulations to assess flight and airspace efficiency, evaluate proposed airspace changes, and provide intelligence on ATM performance that delivers tangible outcomes for our airline customers.
        You will be a part of a multidiscipline team of data scientists, mathematicians, scientists, engineers and subject matter experts to provide services across Airservices groups, with a leading role in the development and innovation of new methodologies

This Australian firm has been helping corporate Australia make sense of Data for the last 2 decades. With a team of 60 of the best technologists in Data, they work with some of the most innovative technologies
              and methodologies in this space and have continually lead the way in Australian Data Analytics.

The Culture

Typically the team here GET data, and are active in the community, winning hackathons, kaggle comps
              and developing interesting Data Visualisations in their spare time. 

They are a very friendly bunch, and organise a fair few staff and client events to either have a drink and a catch up or to review some interesting and new
              to market technology.

The Opportunity

With 3 new projects signed up for Data Science engagements there are several vacancies for Data Scientists with good experience across R and Machine Learning who love solving
              client problems. For commercial in confidence reasons we can nit say too much about the projects, although 2 are in Banking, 1 in retail all with a forecasting, Data Mining and Predictive element. As these are perm roles - you will role
              on to other projects across industries.

The Technology

We expect you to make use of the usual Data Science tool kit (R/Python/Machine Learning - Logistic Regression, K Nearest, etc) and would love you to be
              familiar with Alteryx, although as you no doubt have a brian like a small planet - are happy to help you develop some skills in this product.


There are heaps of consulting firms in this space, some good, some less so. Whats rare
              is to find a group that truly innovates, brings new products to market and has such a strong sales capability.

The COO tells me he sees that he is interested in people that would rather be working crafting unique and elegant solutions
              versus the usual standardised big firm approach. 

If you are the sort of engineer that would rather be hand building Aston Martins, rather than on the production line at Ford, you will fit in fine here.

        The Organisation
        Airservices is a government owned organisation providing safe, secure, efficient and environmentally responsible services to the aviation industry. 
Each year we manage over four million aircraft movements carrying more than 156 million passengers,
          and provide air navigation services across 11 per cent of the world’s airspace.
Airservices has two major operating centres in Melbourne and Brisbane and a corporate office in Canberra. We operate 29 air traffic towers at international and
          regional airports, and provide aviation rescue firefighting services at 26 Australian airports.
        The Role
        Network Performance and Analysis (NP&A) are responsible for delivering actionable intelligence to the business around complex Air Traffic Management (ATM) system performance and optimisation. A typical application is the development of high-fidelity
          aircraft trajectory modelling and fast time simulations to assess flight and airspace efficiency, evaluate proposed airspace changes, and provide intelligence on ATM performance that delivers tangible outcomes for our airline customers.
        You will be a part of a multidiscipline team of data scientists, mathematicians, scientists, engineers and subject matter experts to provide services across Airservices groups, with a leading role in the development and innovation of new methodologies
          for evaluating Air Traffic Management performance, and identifying areas for improvement. Our team is dynamic and flexible, and we are all interested in thinking laterally to solve new problems in airspace analysis.
        The Person
        As Modelling and Simulation Lead you will be responsible for the provision of complex fast-time air traffic simulation and other modelling work, as well as the provision of specialist aeronautical and operational support and advice to different
          groups within Airservices.
        You will also be responsible for supervising staff members, managing the team’s workload and priorities, the development of the team’s capabilities and the performance of the team. The role provides support to the Network Performance and Analysis
          Manager, and requires advanced understanding of air traffic operations, systems and functions.The role requires a person with a high level of interpersonal and communications skills, able to establish, develop and maintain effective working
          relationships, and who enjoys innovating, researching, learning new skills and adapting to a variety of challenges.
        You will be expected to apply your expertise to complex data, and draw from relevant experience to support and improve outcomes for Airservices and its airline customers. A key component of the work will be to consider options for proposed airspace
          designs using available data and tools: assessing designs for aircraft efficiency (reduced delay and fuel-burn), and overall airspace efficiency (reduced risk, conflicts, delay and ATC workload).
        Skills and Experience
        The successful applicant will have:
        
          Tertiary qualifications in aviation, science, engineering, computer science, mathematics or a related discipline.
          A minimum of two years professional experience in a similar role, with expertise in a range of technical areas such as modelling, simulation, data analysis, operations research, applied mathematics, scripting and programming languages (experience
            in one or more of the following languages: Python, Java, Matlab, C, or R is required).
          Understanding of the aviation industry, and knowledge / experience in technical aspects of aviation (e.g. aeronautics, air transport operations, air traffic management).
          Experience in the analysis of complex data using modern data science methods (e.g. machine learning, optimisation, numerical analysis)

The Organisation
Airservices is a government owned organisation providing safe, secure, efficient and environmentally responsible services to the aviation industry. 
Each year we manage over four million aircraft movements carrying more than 156 million passengers, and provide air navigation services across 11 per cent of the world’s airspace.
Airservices has two major operating centres in Melbourne and Brisbane and a corporate office in Canberra. We operate 29 air traffic towers at international and regional airports, and provide aviation rescue firefighting services at 26 Australian airports.
The Role
Network Performance and Analysis (NP&A) are responsible for delivering actionable intelligence to the business around complex Air Traffic Management (ATM) system performance and optimisation. A typical application is the development of high-fidelity aircraft trajectory modelling and fast time simulations to assess flight and airspace efficiency, evaluate proposed airspace changes, and provide intelligence on ATM performance that delivers tangible outcomes for our airline customers.
You will be a part of a multidiscipline team of data scientists, mathematicians, scientists, engineers and subject matter experts to provide services across Airservices groups, with a leading role in the development and innovation of new methodologies for evaluating Air Traffic Management performance, and identifying areas for improvement. Our team is dynamic and flexible, and we are all interested in thinking laterally to solve new problems in airspace analysis.
The Person
As Modelling and Simulation Lead you will be responsible for the provision of complex fast-time air traffic simulation and other modelling work, as well as the provision of specialist aeronautical and operational support and advice to different groups within Airservices.
You will also be responsible for supervising staff members, managing the team’s workload and priorities, the development of the team’s capabilities and the performance of the team. The role provides support to the Network Performance and Analysis Manager, and requires advanced understanding of air traffic operations, systems and functions.The role requires a person with a high level of interpersonal and communications skills, able to establish, develop and maintain effective working relationships, and who enjoys innovating, researching, learning new skills and adapting to a variety of challenges.
You will be expected to apply your expertise to complex data, and draw from relevant experience to support and improve outcomes for Airservices and its airline customers. A key component of the work will be to consider options for proposed airspace designs using available data and tools: assessing designs for aircraft efficiency (reduced delay and fuel-burn), and overall airspace efficiency (reduced risk, conflicts, delay and ATC workload).
Skills and Experience
The successful applicant will have:

Tertiary qualifications in aviation, science, engineering, computer science, mathematics or a related discipline.
A minimum of two years professional experience in a similar role, with expertise in a range of technical areas such as modelling, simulation, data analysis, operations research, applied mathematics, scripting and programming languages (experience in one or more of the following languages: Python, Java, Matlab, C, or R is required).
Understanding of the aviation industry, and knowledge / experience in technical aspects of aviation (e.g. aeronautics, air transport operations, air traffic management).
Experience in the analysis of complex data using modern data science methods (e.g. machine learning, optimisation, numerical analysis)
Demonstrated ability to lead and work collaboratively as part of a small multi-disciplinary technical team.
Demonstrated ability to deliver and present analysis outcomes to different audiences ranging from technical experts to senior management, both orally and in writing.

        Data Scientist - People Insights | Eight Mile Plains (QLD)
         
        Our Story:
        The Woolworths Group has been focused on levering digital and data to create better team and customer experiences. We want to create shopping experiences that are personalised, seamless and convenient, and for that we need an empowered, engaged
          and capable team. To help achieve that goal, we are setting up a People Insights team that will use our wealth of people data to better understand what our teams need to thrive.
         
        What we do:
        We are part of the People Services team at Woolworths - a team that gets work done while having fun and maintaining balance. As part of the People Insights team, you will collaborate closely with a team of experienced people analysts. Together,
          we will make sense of excitingly complex and multifaceted data.
         
        We want to be known for delivering insights that are timely, solid and impactful. Given the complexity and volume of data that we work with (Woolworths employs about 200.000 people), we need state-of-the-art and custom-built
          machine learning algorithms to create these insights. That is where you come in.
         
        Where we are:
        Our team is based at the Eight Mile Plains Technology Park, a short drive south of Brisbane. This new site has been designed to support flexible working with spaces that facilitate collaboration, video conferencing, brainstorming or just
          having a yarn. There is ample parking and the site can be reached by bike or public transport as well.
         
        What we are looking for:
        The purpose of this role is to develop and productionize advanced machine learning algorithms to make sense of our people and performance data. Working together with a data engineer and experienced HR analyst, you will build models that predict
          relevant outcomes, cluster or classify people along relevant dimensions, map out trends and identify exceptions to the trends, and/or provide real-time information for people advisors based on historical data.
         
        The roles key objectives include:
        
          
            Develop, test, productionize and maintain state of the art advanced statistical and machine learning models to better understand and manage our people.
          
          
            Complete and accurately document all development.
          
          
            Engage with business partners and delivery teams to ensure algorithms are delivered and implemented into production systems.
          
          
            Mentor and upskill HR analysts to help a larger group transition to state-of-the-art data mining and insights generation.
          
          
            Interpret analysis and modelling results in a business context and help develop recommendations to support business decisions.
          
        
        
  
        Who you are:
        You are a team player who is driven to achieve the best result and is excited about digging through data and building a set of algorithms that haven’t been built before. You’re curious and empathetic, and the prospect of
          improving the working lives of thousands of Australians through data energises you. You deal with complexity by collaborating with colleagues, listening to business partners, testing ideas and continuously learning. You take authorship for and
          pride in what you create, yet are not too precious about your code when it needs to evolve. Our business moves fast and moves often, so we all have to be nimble.
         
        You will need to have:
        
          
            At least 5 years experience developing class-leading predictive, clustering and/or classification models in commercial environments.
          
          
            A good understanding of the various ways that data can be analysed and the algorithms that exist for each of those ways.
          
          
            Proven commercial experience in statistical and machine learning modelling, with experience manipulating and ‘making sense’ of big data from disparate systems.
          
          
            Advanced skills in analytical programming: SQL, R and/or Python.
          
          
            Experience with SAP in general, and Hana in particular.
          
          
            Experience in working in complex, multi-stakeholder environments.
          
          
            Strong analytical skills with the ability to collect, organise, analyse and disseminate significant amounts of information with attention to detail and accuracy.
          
          
            Tertiary qualification in relevant discipline (Statistics, Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science). A PhD would be an asset, but is not required.
          
          
            Experience with HR or people data would be an asset.
          
          
            An open mind and an agile attitude: we want to move fast and be flexible.
          
        
         
        What's in it for you:
        
          
            The opportunity to contribute to the transformation of one of the largest HR shared services centres of Australia, and to become part of our internal network of dozens of data scientists that includes some of the brightest minds in Australia.

   Data Scientist - People Insights | Eight Mile Plains (QLD)  Our Story: The Woolworths Group has been focused on levering digital and data to create better team and customer experiences. We want to create shopping experiences that are personalised, seamless and convenient, and for that we need an empowered, engaged and capable team. To help achieve that goal, we are setting up a People Insights team that will use our wealth of people data to better understand what our teams need to thrive.  What we do: We are part of the People Services team at Woolworths - a team that gets work done while having fun and maintaining balance. As part of the People Insights team, you will collaborate closely with a team of experienced people analysts. Together, we will make sense of excitingly complex and multifaceted data.  We want to be known for delivering insights that are timely, solid and impactful. Given the complexity and volume of data that we work with (Woolworths employs about 200.000 people), we need state-of-the-art and custom-built machine learning algorithms to create these insights. That is where you come in.  Where we are: Our team is based at the Eight Mile Plains Technology Park, a short drive south of Brisbane. This new site has been designed to support flexible working with spaces that facilitate collaboration, video conferencing, brainstorming or just having a yarn. There is ample parking and the site can be reached by bike or public transport as well.  What we are looking for: The purpose of this role is to develop and productionize advanced machine learning algorithms to make sense of our people and performance data. Working together with a data engineer and experienced HR analyst, you will build models that predict relevant outcomes, cluster or classify people along relevant dimensions, map out trends and identify exceptions to the trends, and/or provide real-time information for people advisors based on historical data.  The roles key objectives include:  Develop, test, productionize and maintain state of the art advanced statistical and machine learning models to better understand and manage our people.   Complete and accurately document all development.   Engage with business partners and delivery teams to ensure algorithms are delivered and implemented into production systems.   Mentor and upskill HR analysts to help a larger group transition to state-of-the-art data mining and insights generation.   Interpret analysis and modelling results in a business context and help develop recommendations to support business decisions.  
   Who you are: You are a team player who is driven to achieve the best result and is excited about digging through data and building a set of algorithms that haven’t been built before. You’re curious and empathetic, and the prospect of improving the working lives of thousands of Australians through data energises you. You deal with complexity by collaborating with colleagues, listening to business partners, testing ideas and continuously learning. You take authorship for and pride in what you create, yet are not too precious about your code when it needs to evolve. Our business moves fast and moves often, so we all have to be nimble.  You will need to have:  At least 5 years experience developing class-leading predictive, clustering and/or classification models in commercial environments.   A good understanding of the various ways that data can be analysed and the algorithms that exist for each of those ways.   Proven commercial experience in statistical and machine learning modelling, with experience manipulating and ‘making sense’ of big data from disparate systems.   Advanced skills in analytical programming: SQL, R and/or Python.   Experience with SAP in general, and Hana in particular.   Experience in working in complex, multi-stakeholder environments.   Strong analytical skills with the ability to collect, organise, analyse and disseminate significant amounts of information with attention to detail and accuracy.   Tertiary qualification in relevant discipline (Statistics, Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science). A PhD would be an asset, but is not required.   Experience with HR or people data would be an asset.   An open mind and an agile attitude: we want to move fast and be flexible.   What's in it for you:  The opportunity to contribute to the transformation of one of the largest HR shared services centres of Australia, and to become part of our internal network of dozens of data scientists that includes some of the brightest minds in Australia.   An exciting career: as our business and our focus on data and digital grows, so do the opportunities for our team members. Moreover, People Data is rising to the top of the list of many business leaders; your contributions to our transformation will serve your career well.   Training and Education: we pride ourselves in helping you realise your potential and give you the opportunity to be innovative. You will be trained in working with the Google Cloud Platform, one of the fast growing analytics and big data platforms.   An attractive remuneration package and a great working environment.   If you think you have what it takes and want to be part of one of the most exciting journeys in Australian retail, apply now.  Want to connect?

        The Organisation
        Airservices is a government owned organisation providing safe, secure, efficient and environmentally responsible services to the aviation industry. 
Each year we manage over four million aircraft movements carrying more than 156 million passengers,
          and provide air navigation services across 11 per cent of the world’s airspace.
Airservices has two major operating centres in Melbourne and Brisbane and a corporate office in Canberra. We operate 29 air traffic towers at international and
          regional airports, and provide aviation rescue firefighting services at 26 Australian airports.
        The Role
        Network Performance and Analysis (NP&A) are responsible for delivering actionable intelligence to the business around complex Air Traffic Management (ATM) system performance and optimisation. A typical application is the development of high-fidelity
          aircraft trajectory modelling and fast time simulations to assess flight and airspace efficiency, evaluate proposed airspace changes, and provide intelligence on ATM performance that delivers tangible outcomes for our airline customers.
        You will be a part of a multidiscipline team of data scientists, mathematicians, scientists, engineers and subject matter experts to provide services across Airservices groups, with a leading role in the development and innovation of new methodologies
          for evaluating Air Traffic Management performance, and identifying areas for improvement. Our team is dynamic and flexible, and we are all interested in thinking laterally to solve new problems in airspace analysis.

        You will be expected to apply your expertise to complex data, and draw from relevant experience to support and improve outcomes for Airservices and its airline customers. A key component of the work will be to consider options for proposed airspace
          designs using available data and tools: assessing designs for aircraft efficiency (reduced delay and fuel-burn), and overall airspace efficiency (reduced risk, conflicts, delay and ATC workload).
        Skills and Experience
        The successful applicant will have:
        
          Tertiary qualifications in aviation, science, engineering, computer science, mathematics or a related discipline.

        The Role
        Network Performance and Analysis (NP&A) are responsible for delivering actionable intelligence to the business around complex Air Traffic Management (ATM) system performance and optimisation. A typical application is the development of high-fidelity
          aircraft trajectory modelling and fast time simulations to assess flight and airspace efficiency, evaluate proposed airspace changes, and provide intelligence on ATM performance that delivers tangible outcomes for our airline customers.
        You will be a part of a multidiscipline team of data scientists, mathematicians, scientists, engineers and subject matter experts to provide services across Airservices groups, with a leading role in the development and innovation of new methodologies

          designs using available data and tools: assessing designs for aircraft efficiency (reduced delay and fuel-burn), and overall airspace efficiency (reduced risk, conflicts, delay and ATC workload).
        Skills and Experience
        The successful applicant will have:
        
          Tertiary qualifications in aviation, science, engineering, computer science, mathematics or a related discipline.

        My client is an innovative Financial Services giant who are committed to the application of Advanced Analytics and Data Science in order to maintain competitive advantage. As their Data Science function (which is building a reputation for delivering
          real advantages within the business) continues to grow and I am looking for experienced Data Science & Data Insights hires to join their team.

I am looking for candidates from either a Software Engineering/Machine Learning background
          or those from either a Data Science or more traditional Statistical/ Predictive Modelling background who have fluent programming skills (Python and R are essential) and typically have strong academics in a relevant discipline (BSc, MSc, PhD
          Data Science, Statistics, Actuarial, Computer Science et al) and who wish to join a high performing team involved in practically every aspect/business function possible and are regarded as increasingly essential to business improvement.
Alternatively,
          If you have solid SQL experience and have real expertise on finding, delivering Insights and turning data into meaningful information that can drive real business (strategic or tactical) decisions and genuinely add value then this could be the
          role for you. 
If you are a Data Scientist who could also walk into a high performing Senior Insights role with a Consulting firm (eg, presentation skills, customer engagement, strategy and planning, insights to find opportunities, 
          drive sales etc.) then stop what you are doing and send me your CV !- I need to speak with you immediately :-)
 Working with other Data Scientists, specialist 3rd party teams & key stakeholders, your core role will involve the design,
          development, testing and deployment of analytically focused algorithms designed to solve business problems. Your tool-kit to deliver on this will include methods and techniques such as Data Visualisation, Natural Language Processing, Statistical
          & Machine Learning Modelling, BigData etc. Working as part of a high performing team you will work as part of a broader cross-functional group of Data Scientists and Engineers, Back-End Engineers, UX experts so the ability to communicate
          effectively, enjoy the process of having your ideas positively challenged and also looking to improve your peers output is a key component of my clients culture and expectations for you in this role.
 This role requires a strong coding focus
          so it is important that you have fluent programming skills and a strong grasp of computer science/software engineering fundamentals. Working in an Agile environment with a CI philosophy employed you will need to enjoy keeping current with new
          technologies, tools and methodologies and how they can be practically employed. Alternatively, first class Insights Analyst's will be considered regardless of level of coding although the more the merrier is my clients thoughts on this. 
          The ability to thrive is an environment where your core focus is complex problem solving on a daily basis is key. Candidates can come from a diverse set of disciplines so what is important is that you can combine Advanced Analytics qualities
          with software development qualities and have a decent level of commercial and organisational awareness as you apply your Data Science expertise to solve business problems. 
 This is an exciting time to be joining my client as they continue
          their growth internationally and continue to innovate in a vast variety of ways  (e.g. Self Service Analytics/AI arena.  Whilst these roles require first class technical capabilities equally important is the ability to understand business
          problems, business context, have a grasp of organisational and commercial realities and incorporate effectively all these diverse factors into the analytical features/services and algorithms that you build.  
Any candidates with
          experience in Conversational AI and/or ""Text Analytics and / or Speech Analytics would be at a serious advantage.
 My client offers a first class working environment –  professional, collegiate and creative all in one. Working alongside
          some of the finest Data Scientists and Software Engineers anywhere in Australia you can be sure that this role will offer fantastic challenges and opportunities with a real focus on your professional growth. Having a positive attitude towards
          your own self-development is key.
 Ideally I am looking for applications from more Senior candidates (e.g. 5+yrs exp) who can assist with the bigger picture challenges associated with running a high performing product/feature development
          team although candidates with less experience but who can demonstrate they have the technical and business smarts to succeed in this environment should not hesitate to apply.
 In short, this is one of the finest Data Science related opportunities
          you will see in Sydney in 2018. Strong & innovative leadership, a superb work culture and environment, fabulous opportunities for progression given the company trajectory/ pace of growth & the ability to make a meaningful contribution/have

        We are working with an exciting, successful fintech company where machine learning and data science are at the core of their product, growth, profitability and competitive advantage. We are seeking a senior data scientist who has worked in a start-up
          (or small team) and implemented machine learning algorithms in production environments.

Exposure to building reliable Machine Learning infrastructure/pipelines and optimising models and code working closely alongside
          machine learning & data engineers is key to this role. 

This particular requirement is mandatory as we want someone who has overcome similar challenges and problems and knows how to build products and get things deployed.  

From
          a business acumen and cultural fit perspective, you will be well-acquainted with meeting deadlines under pressure and have the ability to draw the line and ship work that isn’t perfect (then iterate and improve later).
 
 
 Required skills & experience:
          

          
            4-5 years of experience in a data science role carrying out modelling and machine learning in a commercial, production environment – preferably a start-up or innovation lab
            Strong SQL, R and Python skills – with experience in Linux OS and working to build real products/applications alongside engineers and dev teams
            Good stakeholder management skills and pragmatism to identify the correct level of accuracy needed for different priorities and projects.
            Insurance or dynamic pricing experience is advantageous but not mandatory
            Passion for learning and keeping up to date with both techniques and developments in the fields of Machine Learning and data-related technologies 
            Spark, Scala, PySpark, Spark-SQL, SparklyR, Java experience would be nice to have. 
           
 What makes this role different:


          
            This is an already successful start-up – well beyond the ‘early days’, with large revenue, recognition and already impressive growth in Australia and overseas markets.
            Production ready: you have probably been looking for a legitimate, challenging role where your work isn’t shelved or looked at as ‘too hard to implement…’
            This is a product-based company and data science is a key competitive advantage for them. Your work is central to their success and this role is due to growth, not catching-up to the market... 
            They have global scope and you would be working with high calibre peers and founders from Google, Yahoo, etc. 
            End-to-end work; if successful, you will be involved in the entire lifecycle from conception to build, finetuning, maintenance, productionisation and refinement.
             
If you are interested in this role, but have not been working on implementing and deploying machine learning models in production yet - please check some of our other openings, which may be more suited to you at this stage of
          your career.

 You will be focused on the customer, working closely with pricing, marketing and personalisation in the digital practice. The big data environment was established 10 months ago and you would be working with the business on a major user case for personalisation. This will involve building models that can do things like recommending destinations and next best offers for customers based on behaviour.

 In this role, you will need to make sense of customer data and build models and algorithms using predictive and machine learning techniques. The hiring manager also needs somebody that can articulate to the business what the data means for them.

 The majority of your time spent in this role will be spent on data modelling, mainly with Python and SQL. The other part of the role is communicating insights to the business stakeholders and making sure that the work you are doing aligns with what the business wants to achieve.

 You will need to be able to work independently and have a statistics, programming and data science background. A commercial, technical, academic or operational background will be helpful.

 There is lots of variety in the work you will be doing, as part of a diverse team. Work life balance is important to this business and flexible working from home arrangements are available. There are also big company perks, including huge discounts on domestic and international flights for you and your spouse/partner with a number of different airlines.

 The ideal candidate will be passionate about analytics and data science. This can be a fast paced and dynamic working environment. You will need to lead, prioritise tasks and work as part of a team.

 Junior, intermediate and senior Data Scientists are encouraged to apply, as there are two positions available.
